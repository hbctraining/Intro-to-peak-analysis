## Peak visualization using IGV

There are no coding questions for this lesson.

## Annotation and functional analysis of DE regions

**1. Subset the annot_res_all to keep only the results with FDR < 0.05 and save it to a variable called annot_sig_all. Now create the same annotation plots. Do you observe any difference?**

```{r}
annot_sig_all <- subset(annot_res_all, FDR < 0.05)
plotAnnoBar(annot_sig_all, title = "Feature distribution in significant peaks")
plotDistToTSS(annot_sig_all, title = "Distribution of transcription factor-binding loci relative to TSS in significant peaks")
```

The original images for the full dataset will also be shown below for comparison purposes.

Significantly DE peaks are more likely to be in "other intronic" and "distal intergenic" regions (purple and yellow sections of feature distribution) and less likely to be in "promoter" regions (light blue) compared to the full results.

Significantly DE peaks are also further from the TSS.

**2. Further subset the significant results by filtering on on fold change (Fold). Save the results into variables called annot_sig_up and annot_sig_down. Now create the same annotation plots. Do you observe any difference?**

```{r}
annot_sig_up   <- subset(annot_sig_all, Fold > 0)
annot_sig_down <- subset(annot_sig_all, Fold < 0)
plotAnnoBar(annot_sig_up, title = "Feature distribution in upregulated peaks")
plotAnnoBar(annot_sig_down, title = "Feature distribution in downregulated peaks")
plotDistToTSS(annot_sig_up, title = "Distribution of transcription factor-binding loci relative to TSS in upregulated peaks")
plotDistToTSS(annot_sig_down, title = "Distribution of transcription factor-binding loci relative to TSS in downregulated peaks")
```

<img src="../img/Chipseq_featuredist_sig_up.png"  width="500">
<img src="../img/Chipseq_featuredist_sig_down.png"  width="500">
</p>

Significantly upregulated peaks have a similar feature distribution to all significantly DE peaks; however, downregulated peaks are more likely to be in "other intronic" and "distal intergenic" regions and are never in the 5' UTR or downstream (which makes the colors change between the plots, look carefully at the legend!).

Upregulated peaks are slightly closer to the TSS, while downregulated peaks are slightly further from the TSS.

**3. Perform the ORA for the downregulated sites in cKO vs WT results. Do you find any significantly over-represented terms? If not, think about possible reasons, and try increasing the adjusted p-value cutoff to 0.1 to get an idea of what pathways may be downregulated in cKO samples even if they do not reach traditional statistical significance.**

```{r}
# Prepare gene set query for down-regulated genes
sigDown <- dplyr::filter(annot_res_all_df, FDR < 0.05, Fold < 0)
sigDown_genes <- as.character(sigDown$SYMBOL)
# Run over-representation analysis
go_ORA_Down <- enrichGO(gene = sigDown_genes,
                        universe = background_set,
                        keyType = "SYMBOL",
                        OrgDb = org.Mm.eg.db,
                        ont = "ALL",
                        pAdjustMethod = "BH",
                        qvalueCutoff = 0.05,
                        readable = TRUE)
# Look at results
go_ORA_Down_df <- data.frame(go_ORA_Down)
View(go_ORA_Down_df)
```

There are no downregulated GO terms with a p-value cutoff of 0.05 (and a q-value cutoff of 0.05). There are fewer downregulated genes than upregulated genes, so maybe fewer pathways are affected, and to a lesser extent.

```{r}
# Run over-representation analysis again with a higher p-value cutoff
# Note that we have changed qvalueCutoff to pvalueCutoff!
go_ORA_Down <- enrichGO(gene = sigDown_genes,
                        universe = background_set,
                        keyType = "ENTREZID",
                        OrgDb = org.Mm.eg.db,
                        ont = "ALL",
                        pAdjustMethod = "BH",
                        pvalueCutoff = 0.1,
                        readable = TRUE)
# Look at results
go_ORA_Down_df <- data.frame(go_ORA_Down)
View(go_ORA_Down_df)
```

With the more lax p-value cutoff, we see a number of pathways related to chemotaxis are downregulated.

**4. Create a dotplot and enrichplot from the ORA result generated earlier using the downregulated sites in cKO vs WT results. What overarching themes are observed from the enrichplot (if any)?**

```{r}
# Dotplot
dotplot(go_ORA_Down)
# Enrich plot
go_ORA_Down <- enrichplot::pairwise_termsim(go_ORA_Down)
emapplot(go_ORA_Down)
```
