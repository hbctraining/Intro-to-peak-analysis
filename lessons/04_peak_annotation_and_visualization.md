## Learning Objectives

* Annotate peaks with genomic features using Chipseeker
* Visualize the annotation and compare peak coverage between experimental groups.
* Explore the biological content using functional enrichment analysis



## Overview

In this tutorial we use ChIPseeker, a Bioconductor package in R to annotate peaks with genomic feaures, explore various ways to visualize them and compare the peak profile and coverage between the experimental groups. We will also perform functional annotation and analysis to explore the biology in our dataset.
