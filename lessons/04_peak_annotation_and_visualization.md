## Learning Objectives

* Annotate peaks with genomic features using Chipseeker.
* Visualize annotations and compare peak coverage between experimental groups.
* Explore biological content using functional enrichment analysis.



## Overview

Understanding the biological questions addressed by ChIP-seq experiments begins with annotating peaks and comparing differences between experimental groups. ChIPseeker, a Bioconductor package in R, facilitates the annotation of genomic features and nearest genes to peaks. It provides tools for visualization, peak profile comparisons, and coverage analyses between experimental conditions.

Additionally, ChIPseeker can assess sample concordance, perform functional annotations, and infer cooperative regulation. For instance, overlapping data from two binding proteins may indicate interaction in regulating gene expression or chromosomal remodeling.

ChIPseeker also supports querying the GEO database to compare experimental datasets with publicly available ChIP-seq data and offers statistical testing for significant overlaps among datasets.

This tutorial demonstrates how to use ChIPseeker to annotate peaks, visualize features, compare profiles, and perform functional analyses to explore the biological context of a dataset.

## Analyzing peaks in a single sample

### cKO_Rep1

We can use `readPeakFile()` function to load peaks from a BED file. It will convert the bed file into GRange object.

```{r}
ckoR1 <- readPeakFile("data/macs2/narrowPeak/cKO_H3K27ac_ChIPseq_REP1_peaks.narrowPeak")

```

### Peak coverage plot
To look at the coverage of the peaks over the whole genome or a section of a genome, we can use `covplot()` function.

```{r}
covplot(ckoR1, weightCol = "V5", chrs = c("chr1", "chr2"))
```

</p>

### Heatmap profile of ChIP binding to TSS regions
To plot the profile of peaks binding to TSS region, we need to prepare the TSS regions. These are the flanking sequence of the TSS sites, here we are settting up the flanking regions of 2000bp upstream and 2000bp downstream. Then align the peaks that are mapping to these regions, and generate the tagMatrix. This tagMatrix can be visualized as a heatmap with the function `tagHeatmap()`.

```{r}
txdb <- TxDb.Mmusculus.UCSC.mm10.knownGene
promoter <- getPromoters(TxDb = txdb, upstream = 2000, downstream = 2000)
tagMatrix_ckoR1 <- getTagMatrix(ckoR1, windows = promoter)
tagHeatmap(tagMatrix_ckoR1)
```

<p align="center">
<img src="../img/Chipseq_tagheatmap1.png"  width="600">
</p>


> Note: Tag matrices can also be created for other genomic regions and visualized as heatmaps.

### Average profile of ChIP peaks binding to TSS region

```{r}
plotAvgProf(tagMatrix_ckoR1, xlim=c(-2000, 2000), 
            xlab="Genomic Region (5'->3')", ylab = "Read Count Frequency")
```

<p align="center">
<img src="../img/Chipseq_avg.profile1.png"  width="600">
</p>

> Note: Confidence intervals, estimated using bootstrap methods, are supported for characterizing binding profiles.

### Peak annotation

Annotation of the peaks to the nearest gene and for various genomic characteristics is performed by `annotatePeak()` function. By default TSS region is defined as -3kb to +3kb, however user can define their region. The result of the annotation comes in csAnno (a special format for ChIP-seq annotation). This can be converted to GRanges with `as.GRanges()` format and to data frame with `as.data.frame()` function.

> Note: Bioconductor provides annotation database `TxDb` for commonly used genome version to use for annotation in ChIPseeker, e.g. `TxDb.Mmusculus.UCSC.mm10.knownGene`, `TxDb.Mmusculus.UCSC.mm9.knownGene`, `TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg38.knownGene`, `TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19.knownGene`, User can also prepare prepare their own database object using UCSC Genome Bioinformatics and BioMart database in R with `makeTxDbFromBiomart()` and `makeTxDbFromUCSC.TxDb()`

Lets annotate our peakset:

```{r}
txdb <- TxDb.Mmusculus.UCSC.mm10.knownGene
annot.ckoR1 = annotatePeak(ckoR1, tssRegion=c(-3000, 3000),TxDb=txdb, annoDb="org.Mm.eg.db")
```

>Note: The parameter `annoDb` is optional, if provided extra information about the annotation including gene symbol, genename, ensembl/entrezid will be added in extra columns.

The annotation output file retains all the information from the peak file and also reports the annotation information. The nearest genes, their position and strand information along with the distance from peak to the tSS of its nearest gene is also reported.

### Annotation visualization

There are several visualization tools provided by ChIPseeker package to effectively visualize annotation of various genomic features. 

Pie, Bar, and upsetR plots are supported to visualize the genomic annotation.

#### Piechart


```{r}
plotAnnoPie(annot.ckoR1)
```

<p align="center">
<img src="../img/annot.pie1.png"  width="600">
</p>

#### Barplot

```{r}
plotAnnoBar(annot.ckoR1)
```

<p align="center">
<img src="../img/chipseq_annotbar1.png"  width="600">
</p>


#### UpsetR

Annotation overlaps can be visualized by upsetR plot.
```{r}
upsetplot(annot.ckoR1)
```

<p align="center">
<img src="../img/Chipseq_upset1.png"  width="600">
</p>

### Distribution of TF-binding loci with respect to TSS

The distance between peak and the TSS of the nearest gene is reported in the annotation output and can be visualzed with barplot.

```{r}
plotDistToTSS(annot.ckoR1)
```

<p align="center">
<img src="../img/chipseq_tss1.png"  width="600">
</p>


## Exercise:

Carryout similar visualization and annotation for a replicate of WT sample `WT_Rep1`.
Work along the codes below:

Use `readPeakFile()` function to import the peakset as GRange object.

```{r}
wtR1 <- readPeakFile("data/macs2/narrowPeak/WT_H3K27ac_ChIPseq_REP1_peaks.narrowPeak")

```

### Peak coverage plot
Use `covplot()` to visualize the coverage of the peaks in the genome.
You can look at a different chromosome or the whole genome by removing `chrs=` options. 

```{r}
covplot(wtR1, weightCol = "V5", chrs = c("chr1", "chr2"))
```

Image below is for chromosome 1 and 2.

Generate the tagMatrix and plot the heatmap.


```{r}
txdb <- TxDb.Mmusculus.UCSC.mm10.knownGene
promoter <- getPromoters(TxDb = txdb, upstream = 2000, downstream = 2000)
tagMatrix_wtR1 <- getTagMatrix(wtR1, windows = promoter)
tagHeatmap(tagMatrix_wtR1)
```

### Average profiles of all the samples

We can plot average profile of all the samples together. For that we need to make a list of list of tagMatrix.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
tagMatrix_list <- list(
  cKO_Rep1 = tagMatrix_ckoR1,
  cKO_Rep2 = tagMatrix_ckoR2,
  cKO_Rep3 = tagMatrix_ckoR3,
  WT_Rep1 = tagMatrix_wtR1,
  WT_Rep2 = tagMatrix_wtR2,
  WT_Rep3 = tagMatrix_wtR3
)

plotAvgProf(tagMatrix_list, xlim = c(-2000, 2000), facet = "row")
```
