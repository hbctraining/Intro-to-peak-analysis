## Learning Objectives

* Describe workflow management tools for bioinformatics analysis
* Overview of nf-core chipseq and understanding inputs and outputs


## Workflow managers for bioinformatics analysis 
In the previous lesson we described the steps involved in going from raw sequence reads (FASTQ) to peak calls. Each step involves a different tool and typically is followed by some level of quality checks that follow. In this workshop, we provide lessons describing the workflow downstream of peak calls. It is **important to thoroughly understand individual steps**, the nuances of each tool and the inputs and outputs. Therefore, when starting out on your analysis running each command in the workflow is advanatageous. However, as you start to scale up and you are running analyses on large datasets with many samples, using a workflow manager is something to consider.


### Why use a workflow manager?

 A **workflow manager**, in simple terms, is a tool or software that **helps you organize and execute a series of tasks in a specific order**. Below we outline some features of using a workflow manager:

* **Modularity**:
    * The different steps in workflow are broken down into modular components (ie. FASTQC, genome alignment)
    * Modules can be reused in different analyses or modified to run the same analysis but tweaking certain parameters         
* **Automation**:
    * Once you have the complete workflow assembled, the process can easily be repeated on multiple samples and/or datasets
    * Automating reduces the likelihood of human error and saves time 
* **Scalability**:
    * Workflow managers can efficiently handle large datasets and computationally intensive tasks, by distributing them across multiple processors or nodes.
    * Tasks are scheduled based on available resources, dependencies, and priorities
    * Troubleshooting is more manageable because error-handling capabilities help in identifying failed processes and understanding the reasons behind failures
*  **Reproducibility**:
    *  There is typically documentation including metadata and provenenance tracking providing clarity on what was done
    *  Standardized workflows with transparency on software, parameter usage and versions




## Nextflow

## nf-core chipseq

Also, here is information about the nf-core pipeline, which has each step plainly and nicely laid out (though there is not a lot of explanation of what each step does)
