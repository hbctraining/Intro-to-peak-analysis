## Concordant peak calls between samples

In the previous lesson, we evaluated quality metrics concerning peaks and reads in peaks in individual samples. But these aren't the only ways to measure quality in our data set. We did look for consistency of these metrics across all of our samples, but now it's time for a closer look at our samples to see how concordant they are, particularly for samples within treatment groups, as we expect these samples to look more similar to each other than they do to samples in other treatment groups.

## Variance Stabilizing Transformation (VST)

Before we look at peak concordance, we will want to normalize our samples to account for library size and composition. This will make our samples more comparable. If your data was processed using nf-core and our bcbioR pipeline, then this step will already be taken care of for us. But if you're working from your own data set, you'll need to load the DESeq2 library and run the `vst()` function on your raw counts. Conveniently, the `vst()` function will calculate the library size of your files, so you don't have to take an extra step to do that:

```
library(DESeq2)

vst_norm_counts <- vst(raw_counts)
```

However, as mentioned, this step is already taken care of for us. We can load our data in and move on to the next steps.

First, we will load in two additional data objects, `dds` and `peaks.rds`.

The `dds.rds` object contains counts from a DESeq2 dds object ####COUNT DATA FROM WHAT, HOW DOES THIS DIFFER FROM PEAKS ALSO THE OBJECT IS ACTUALLY A FULL DDS DESPITE LOAD_DATA.R ALLEGEDLY EXTRACTING ONLY THE COUNTS. It was created from the `H3K27ac.consensus_peaks.rds` output from nf-core ###EXPLAIN WHAT NFCORE DID TO THIS DATA. You can download the `dds` object [here] ####INSERT LINK. 

The `peaks.rds` object was created from XXXX output from nf-coure, which then underwent some addditional processing in our `load_data.R` script ###EXPLAIN WHAT NFCORE AND LOAD_DATA.R DID TO THIS DATA. It contains peaks data ####EXPLAIN IN MORE DETAIL. ####LINK TO SCRIPT AS REFERENCE. You can download the `peaks.rds` object [here] ####INSERT LINK. 

```
peaks <- readRDS("peaks.rds")
dds <- readRDS("dds.rds")
```

Then, we will do some additional processing to add metadata (`coldata`) from our `metrics` object to our `dds` and `peaks` objects to make them easier to plot:

```
#extract metadata from metrics corresponding to the sample names in dds
rownames(metrics) <- metrics$sample
coldata_for_dds = metrics[colnames(dds),]
stopifnot(all(colnames(dds) == rownames(coldata_for_dds)))
```

Now we are ready to start looking at peak concordancE

## Signal enrichment vs peak rank

One way to evaluate concordance of peaks between samples is a signal enrichment vs peak rank plot. This shows the rank of each peak vs the strength of each peak for each repilcate. It will help us evaluate the number of peaks we would retain if thresholding by peak enrichment:

```
ggplot(peaks, aes(x = peak_rank, y = peak_enrichment, color = sample)) + 
  geom_line() +
  xlab("Peak rank") + ylab("Peak enrichment")
```

It is also valuable to see how this differs between replicates within a sample group. By adding faceting to our plot, we can more easily look at samples within each genotaype to evaluate sample similarity:

```
ggplot(peaks, aes(x = peak_rank, y = peak_enrichment, color = sample)) + 
  geom_line() +
  facet_grid(. ~ genotype) +
  xlab("Peak rank") + ylab("Peak enrichment")
```

Our data looks pretty consistent between samples until enrichment is low ####COMMENT ON MEANING BHIND THIS

## Histogram of quality scores

Here, we plot a histogram of peak signal values for each sample. This plot can be used to help determine a minimum value for peak enrichment that can be used for filtering. 

```
ggplot(peaks, aes(x = peak_enrichment, fill = .data[[params$factor_of_interest]])) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(peak_enrichment)) +
  scale_fill_cb_friendly() +
  xlab("Peak enrichment")
```

## Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a technique used to emphasize variation and bring out strong patterns in a dataset (dimensionality reduction). This is a very important technique used in the QC and analysis of ChIPseq.

If you've done any RNAseq or single cell analysis, you're likely familiar with the concept of PCA, as this technique is used to evaluate. If you'd like to refamiliarize yourself on the details of how PCA is calculated, we recommend you read our materials [[here]](https://hbctraining.github.io/DGE_workshop_salmon_online/lessons/principal_component_analysis.html) or [[watch this useful video from StatQuest]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UVHneBUBW0&ab_channel=StatQuestwithJoshStarmer).

### Interpreting PCA plots
Essentially, if two samples have similar levels of expression peak enrichment that contribute significantly to the variation represented by a given PC (Principal Component), they will be plotted close together on the axis that represents that PC. Therefore, we would expect that biological replicates to have similar scores (because our expectation is that the same genes are changing) and cluster together. This is easiest to understand by visualizing some example PCA plots.

We can run PCA to evaluate the variation amongst our samples and whether or not the greatest sources of variation in the data (PC1 and PC2) can be attributed to the factors of interest in this experiment.

We will be plotting the Variance Stabalized Transformation (VST) counts from our dds object and usin a package called degPCA which automatically performs the PCA dimensionality reduction and plots the results. To start, we will look at both PC1 vs PC2 and PC3 vs PC4 colored by the condition "genotype", since that is the primaro factor of interest for us:

```
library(degPCA)
pca1v2 <- degPCA(assays(dds)$vst, coldata_for_dds,
              condition = "genotype", data = T)[["plot"]]
pca3v4 <- degPCA(assays(dds)$vst, coldata_for_dds,
              condition = "genotype", data = T, pc1="PC3", pc2="PC4")[["plot"]]

pca1v2
pca3v4

```

####INSERT pc1v2 AND pca3v4 SIDE BY SIDE

We are fortunate that our data separates on PC1, which accounts for the most amount of variance in the data, by genotype. If this were not the case, we would want to consider coloring our data points by other aspects of the metadata (`coldata_for_dds` object). In our case, that would be mostly technical factors, but if our samples were processed in different batches, or performed on different dates; or if the samples were from tissues with different sexes or other features, these would be important features to label our plot by when looking at PCA. If any factor contributed to a large amount of variance in the data, we might need to take further steps to take these factors into account

## Hierarchical clustering

Inter-correlation analysis (ICA) is another way to look at how well samples cluster by plotting the correlation between the peak regions of the samples. We can also add metadata to this plot to see if any factors explain any of the clustering on any level.

First, we will compute the correlation of our VST-normalized peak counts using the Pearson correlation ####INCLUDE EXPLANATION? RATIONAL? INFO ABOUT COR() AND OTHER OPTIONS?:

```
vst_cor <- cor(assays(dds)$vst)
```

Then, we will subset our metadata. Here, we are just selecting genotype, but it is a good idea to plot other things, like batch, or other technical factors, especially if we saw our data segregate by them on any of the PCs

```
colma=coldata_for_dds %>% as.data.frame()
rownames(colma) <- colma$sample
colma <- colma[rownames(vst_cor), ]
colma <- colma %>% dplyr::select(genotype)
```

Finally, we can make the heatmap itself:

```
p <- pheatmap(vst_cor, 
         annotation = colma,
         #annotation_colors = anno_colors,
         show_rownames = T, 
         show_colnames = T, 
         )
p
```

####INSERT HEATMAP HERE

As expected given what we saw in the PCA plots, our samples cluster nicely by genotype. If we had more samples and plotted more metadata, we might also be able to see whether batch or other biological or technical factor affected the clustering, and on what level.
