## Learning Objectives

* Visualize peaks in IGV (Integrative Genomics Viewer).
* Understand the file formats used for visualiztion.
* Use R package (graphViz/rtracklayer) to plot and study differential peak enrichment between experimental groups.


## Overview

Integrate Genomics Viewer (IGV) is an open-source desktop genome visualization tool. Below we will learn about the file formats used to visualize peaks in IGV and use it to explore peaks in our experiment samples. We will also use graphViz/rtracklayer to plot the peak signals in R. 

Use material from variant calling workshop [setting up IGV](https://hbctraining.github.io/variant_analysis/lessons/12_IGV.html)
