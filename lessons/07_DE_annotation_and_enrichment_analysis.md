## Learning Objectives

* Annotate and visualize the differentially bound regions.
* Understand the biological meaning using functional enrichment analysis.


## Overview

Here, we will annotate the differentially bound sites and visualize them. We will also perform functional enrichment analysis to explore the biological meaning in our comparative analysis. 


- Annotate DE regions with target genes.
- IGV validation of differentially enriched regions
- Functional analysis
