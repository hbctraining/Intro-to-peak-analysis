## Learning Objectives

* Annotate and visualize the differentially bound regions.
* Understand the biological meaning using functional enrichment analysis.





## Overview

Here, we will annotate the differentially bound sites and visualize them. We will also perform functional enrichment analysis to explore the biological meaning in our comparative analysis.
