Approximate time: 

## Learning Objectives

* Describe the workflow for calling peaks
* Highlight important/challenging steps in the workflow



## From sequence reads to peak calls

**TAKE CONTENT FROM HERE: https://hbctraining.github.io/Intro-to-ChIPseq-flipped/schedule/**

Also, here is information about the nf-core pipeline, which has each step plainly and nicely laid out (though there is not a lot of explanation of what each step does)
