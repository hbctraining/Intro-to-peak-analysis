Approximate time: 

## Learning Objectives

* Carryout data exploratory analysis and visualization for sample concordance.
* Learn to use DiffBind for differential binding analysis and evaluate the results.
* Annotate and visualize the differentially bound sites
* Explore the biological content using functional enrichment analysis.



## Overview

In this tutorial we will perform PCA and correlational heatmaps to study the sample relation. We will learn how to use DiffBind package to carryout differential binding analysis. Use Chipseeker to annotate the differentially bound sites. We will employ various ploting methods to evaluate the results. We will also carryout functional enrichment analysis to understand the biological meaning of the result.
